Command Line Utility
<br>
I made this command line utility using argparse module in python. <br>
Can be used to download a file from internet using link.<br>
Argparse, Requests. <br>
To use the code: < python {name_of_codefile}.py url > for without giving local name. <br>
                 < python {name_of_codefile}.py url -o {local_file_name}> with local name.
